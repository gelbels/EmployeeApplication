        <h3>APPLICATION ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND WAIVER <br> PLEASE READ CAREFULLY AND SIGN</h3>

        <p>In consideration of my job application by Unfinished Business, I agree to the following terms:</p>
        <ol>
            <p>I acknowledge that the acceptance of my application and any subsequent employment,
                whether in the position I applied for or in any other role, does not constitute an implied or actual
                employment
                contract.
                This means that my status as an employee of Unfinished Business remains "at-will,"
                and any changes to this relationship can only be made through a written agreement signed by
                Unfinished Business's President/General Manager. Both Unfinished Business and I have the right to
                terminate the
                employment relationship
                at any time, with or without cause. Furthermore, Unfinished Business reserves the right to change
                its benefits,
                policies, and procedures, which may include benefit cuts.</p>
            <p>I authorize Unfinished Business to investigate the information I have provided in this application.
                I understand that any misrepresentation or omission of facts may result in my immediate dismissal.
                I also authorize Unfinished Business to contact my schools, previous employers (unless otherwise
                specified),
                references, and others.
                In addition, I release Unfinished Business from any and all liability resulting from these
                inquiries.</p>
            <p>Unfinished Business has a drug and alcohol policy that includes pre-employment testing as well as
                ongoing testing
                during employment.
                Compliance with this policy is a requirement of my job, and my continued employment is contingent on
                passing
                these
                tests.
                Furthermore, I am aware that job-related physical examinations may be required.
                Unfinished Business may obtain an investigative consumer report from a consumer reporting agency,
                which may include information about my credit history, character, reputation, personal
                characteristics, and
                lifestyle.
                Unfinished Business will provide additional information about the nature and scope of any such
                report upon my
                written request,
                as required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
            </p>
            <p>My position at Unfinished Business will be on probation for sixty (60) days.
                The employment relationship between Unfinished Business and me is terminable at will by either party
                at any time
                during the probationary period or thereafter, without the need for a specific reason.</p>
