    <h1>Unfinished Business</h1>
    <p>Application for Employment</p>

    <h2>PLEASE READ CAREFULLY AND SIGN</h2>
    <h3>APPLICATION ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND WAIVER</h3>
    <p>In consideration of my job application by Unfinished Business, I agree to the following terms:</p><br>
    <p>I acknowledge that the acceptance of my application and any subsequent employment,
        whether in the position I applied for or in any other role, does not constitute an implied or actual employment
        contract.
        This means that my status as an employee of Unfinished Business remains "at-will,"
        and any changes to this relationship can only be made through a written agreement signed by
        Unfinished Business's President/General Manager. Both Unfinished Business and I have the right to terminate the
        employment relationship
        at any time, with or without cause. Furthermore, Unfinished Business reserves the right to change its benefits,
        policies, and procedures, which may include benefit cuts.</p><br>
    <p>I authorize Unfinished Business to investigate the information I have provided in this application.
        I understand that any misrepresentation or omission of facts may result in my immediate dismissal.
        I also authorize Unfinished Business to contact my schools, previous employers (unless otherwise specified),
        references, and others.
        In addition, I release Unfinished Business from any and all liability resulting from these inquiries.</p><br>
    <p>Unfinished Business has a drug and alcohol policy that includes pre-employment testing as well as ongoing testing
        during employment.
        Compliance with this policy is a requirement of my job, and my continued employment is contingent on passing
        these
        tests.
        Furthermore, I am aware that job-related physical examinations may be required.
        Unfinished Business may obtain an investigative consumer report from a consumer reporting agency,
        which may include information about my credit history, character, reputation, personal characteristics, and
        lifestyle.
        Unfinished Business will provide additional information about the nature and scope of any such report upon my
        written request,
        as required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act.</p><br>
    </p>My position at Unfinished Business will be on probation for sixty (60) days.
    The employment relationship between Unfinished Business and me is terminable at will by either party at any time
    during
    the probationary period or thereafter, without the need for a specific reason.</p></br>
